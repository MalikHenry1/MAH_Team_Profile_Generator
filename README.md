  ## Description 
  
  This repository contains code for a command-line run application that generates a team profile page. 
    
  ## Installation 
  
  This Team Profile Generator uses inquirer and fs packages to generate prompts for the user inputs and properly overwrite files, respectively. Inquirer can be installed using the npm i command in terminal. 

  ## Usage 
  
  Users are given the opportunity to build their team with a Manager (mandatory), Intern, and/or Engineer positions. The prompts begin with having the user input the name, id, email, and office number of the team manager. Once the manager has been properly created, the user is then given the option to add an intern, add an engineer, or complete the team in its current state. Based on the users choice, the prompts will either specify the parameters for an intern (name, id, school) or an engineer (name, id, github) and create profile tags accordingly.
